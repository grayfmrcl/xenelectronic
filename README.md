These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Requirements for the software and other tools to build, test and push 
- [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started)

Install dependencies for client and server application

    cd server
    npm install

    cd client
    npm install
    
Create .env file in /server

    cd server
    touch .env

Fill it with

    NODE_ENV=development
    PORT=3001

This configure the server app to run in the specified environment and port.
You can use different port based on your need.

Create .env file in /client

    cd client
    touch .env
